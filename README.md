Simple Console Based C++ Timer
========================

No frills, simple, easy to use C++ console app.
Alert via wav file sounds like old style windup alarm clock--*loud.*

Not much to see here, I use this as egg timer when cooking in the other room.

 - Enter desired countdown minutes.
 - Enter desired countdown seconds.
 - Bell alerts at end of countdown, countdown shown/updates in cmd prompt.
